        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've been practicing front-end development, using Git as well as learning more about Android development and design since the start of 2015. I'm currently taking courses through Treehouse; you can learn more about Treehouse and view my accomplishments on my<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/stephenyoung7" target="_blank"> profile</a> where I have logged over 150 hours of course work and earned more than 120 acheivements in my spare time.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional cook and gardener and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My biggest goal right now is to obtain as much experience as I can working in the field of my interest and create habits for best practices. In the meantime, I've enrolled in the front-end developer TechDegree on teamtreehouse.com and I expect to complete the program by the end of the summer of 2016. These are some of the skills included in the TechDegree:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
          <li>Gulp</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm interested in earning an internship, entry-level position, or apprenticeship through remote work or with a local Boise company; I'd also appreciate working as a Customer Service rep for a technical business that will expose me to new opportunities for learning.</p>
